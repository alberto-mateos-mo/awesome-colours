# Awesome Colours

A curated list of resources for colour palettes.

I've always struggled choosing the right colours for my data projects so I've decided to create a list with the resources that had helped me the most.

# Resources

* [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) - Provides colour armonies, shades, tints and tones for a given colour.
* [Color Safe](http://colorsafe.co/) - Helps you design a colour palette given a background colour and styling of text.
* [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) - A.I. colour palette generator, you can upload an image to extract its colour palette.
* [Viz Palette](https://projects.susielu.com/viz-palette) - Intended to be used after you have selected a colour palette, shows you examples of charts with your palette.
